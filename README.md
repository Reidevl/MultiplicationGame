# Multiplication Game

## Introduction

This is a project that I developed to complete a project from 100 Days of SwiftUI course in HackingWithSwift.com. The main functionality is to test you how much you known to multiplicate.
The game is easy. At the beginnig you might select the game difficulty by fixing the maximum number on multiplication table, for example if you select 5, you'll be asked to max up to the multiplication table of 5.
You also can select the number of round you want
I made this project following the SOLID principles, I also structurated the project by Views and Components. I used some attributes such as @StateObject, @ObservedObject, @State, @Binding and ViewModel, etc, that allow me improving the code quality without harming the app's reactivity.
At the end, I added some animation to make the app more attractive.
